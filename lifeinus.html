          <p>
            Stay home except to get medical care. Separate yourself from other people in your home, this is known as home isolation
            Call ahead before visiting your doctor. Wear a facemask if you are sick. Cover your coughs and sneezes. Clean your hands often.
            Avoid sharing personal household items. Clean all “high-touch” surfaces everyday. Monitor your symptoms.

          <h2>How to Protect?</h2>
          <p>
            There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
            The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. 
            The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
            Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
            Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
            These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

            Total cases: 7,038 <br>
            Total deaths: 97 <br>
            Jurisdictions reporting cases: 54 (50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and US Virgin Islands)
            * Data include both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 reported to CDC or tested at CDC since January 21, 2020, 
            with the exception of testing results for persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China and Japan. 
            State and local public health departments are now testing and publicly reporting their cases. 
            In the event of a discrepancy between CDC cases and cases reported by state and local public health officials, data reported by states should be considered the most up to date.

          <h2>How is the situation in Michigan?</h2>
          <p>
            The number of positive cases of the coronovirus in Michigan has increased is to 110.
            Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said during a news conference this afternoon that the state knows of at least 30 additional cases that were confirmed Wednesday, according to WXYZ.
            There are seven positive cases in West Michigan, according to the latest detailed case update earlier this afternoon from The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS).
            At the time, the state said there are 80 positive cases.
            Of those 80, thirty-four people, or 43 percent, are hospitalized, and 31 people, or 39%, are not hospitalized. The state says it is "unknown" if the other 15 are hospitalized.

          <h2>Terminology</h2>
          <p>
            The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that "COVID-19" would be the official name of the disease. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said "co" stands for "corona", "vi" for "virus" and "d" for "disease", while "19" was for the year, as the outbreak was first identified on 31 December 2019. Tedros said the name had been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (i.e. China), animal species, or group of people in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatisation.
            While the disease is named COVID-19, the virus that causes it is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2. The virus was initially referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV. The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
